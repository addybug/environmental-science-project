            <p>
              I’ve just completed my stay at Sweni Lodge, located on the banks
              of Sweni River in South Africa and I absolutely adored my time
              there. I decided to stay at Sweni Lodge because of its proximity
              to Kruger National Park.
            </p>

            <p>
              My time in Kruger was very eventful. I did a night drive within
              hours of getting there and was lucky enough to have the rare and
              elusive leopard cross my path! The next day, I awoke early to do a
              full day safari. It was very successful. I saw two lions hunting a
              herd of Cape Buffalo, but they all disappeared in the brush before
              the kill.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also saw monkeys, baboons, elephants, giraffes, hippos, rhinos,
              and basically all there is to see. Another highlight was seeing a
              lion that was crouching behind a bush watching some Water Buck and
              a young Hippo swam up, getting out of the water so that it was
              right in front of the lion! We waited to see what would happen,
              but all the lion did was lay there. I thought for sure we were
              about to witness an attack. The cute Hippo continued on his path
              and walked away.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sweni Lodge was lovely! It is owned by Singita, a conservation
              organization that has multiple luxury, sustainable lodges located
              throughout Africa. Their conservation efforts incorporate the
              three pillars of “Biodiversity, Community and Sustainability.” The
              lodges fund their efforts to promote biodiversity by funding
              projects to end poaching, protect endangered species, and so much
              more. I talked for a long time with my safari guide about the
              numerous initiatives Singita has started at Kruger National Park
              that protect the wildlife and community.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to wildlife protecting, Singita works hard to support
              the local community through education support, enterprise
              development, and raising environmental awareness. I thought it was
              really interesting how much Singita gave back to the community
              through scholarships, funding, and food. Singita also funds
              museums and two local culinary schools to preserve culture.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sweni Lodge is working hard towards sustainability. It is
              currently building solar panels for every lodge and is currently
              at 50% which is very impressive. The locations that do not yet
              have solar panels are currently doing their best to reduce their
              emissions, but hopefully all Singita lodges will be zero emissions
              soon. I was really pleased to hear that Singita has been able to
              reduce the water usage of its lodges. Lodges like Sweni Lodge
              harvest rainwater and monitor water usage daily. In Africa, water
              scarcity is a serious threat so it was nice to hear that Sweni
              Lodge was not contributing to that. Sweni Lodge was adamant about
              recycling and did not sell plastic bottles. Additionally, I was
              explicitly warned not to litter in Kruger and there were many
              waste bins for me to throw away my garbage so that it did not end
              up with the wildlife.
            </p>

            <p>
              I found it very interesting that Sweni Lodge was built using
              reused stones and sustainable materials. Even the toiletries were
              produced locally from environmentally-friendly ingredients and
              packaged sustainably. Food was also locally sourced (and tasted
              delicious).
            </p>

            <p>
              I was super pleased with my time at Sweni Lodge and Kruger
              National Park and I feel great knowing that the beautiful African
              wildlife is being taken care of and protected by such a wonderful
              organization. Hopefully, I will be able to return soon!
            </p>
