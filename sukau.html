            <p>
              Today, I arrived at Sukau Rainforest Lodge. I decided to stay here
              because it is close to Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre.
              The main reason I chose to visit Borneo was to see the Orangutans
              so I was really looking forward to finally seeing them. They did
              not disappoint!
            </p>

            <p>
              What Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre has done to save the
              Orangutans species is amazing! Many Orangutans have died in recent
              years due to deforestation and the destruction of their habitat.
              Baby orangutans take many years to mature (approx. 8 years) and
              cannot survive on their own during that time which makes
              Orangutans especially vulnerable to endangerment. If the baby gets
              separated from its mother, the young orangutan does not know
              enough to survive and dies. The Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre
              takes in orphaned Orangutans and slowly teaches them how to
              survive on their own. When the Orangutans have matured, they are
              released back into the wild. They have trackers on them and can
              see they are doing well.
            </p>

            <p>
              Besides learning about what they do, I also got to see these young
              Orangutans learn how to use ropes, platforms. They learn by
              observing the older Orangutans which I thought was really cool. It
              was so much fun to watch them interact and develop essential
              survival skills through play. Orangutans use both arms and legs to
              carry things and were so curious about how things worked. I also
              caught a glimpse of an older male that was around (not an orphan,
              I think he just hangs around the area). He was 300 pounds. When he
              was near, the staff intervened to keep him at a safe distance. I
              was so inspired by the Centre and definitely want to learn more
              about it when I get back.
            </p>

            <p>
              After the Orangutans, we walked to see the Sun Bears. They are the
              smallest bears in Borneo and were adorable. This sanctuary takes
              them in because people have tried to raise them as pets or have
              trapped them to sell their organs for Asian medicine. There were
              about 30 of them but we could only see about 6 because the others
              were trying to keep cool under rocks or logs. The Sun Bears were
              black with a yellow ring on their neck. They were beautiful and it
              was hard to believe they were once held captive in cages. The Sun
              Bears, too, will be released back in the wild when they are ready.
              Some of the bears do not fear humans enough due to their years of
              domestication and will never be ready so will just live in the
              sanctuary.
            </p>

            <p>
              The resort itself was lovely and incredibly eco friendly. I was
              incredibly impressed by the efforts made by the resort to be as
              “clean” as possible. Since their location is along the banks of
              the Kinabatangan River in Borneo, one of Asia’s most important
              waterways, the resort recognizes its responsibility to maintain
              the quality of the waterway and minimize pollutants as much as
              possible. The rooms used energy saving light builds and inverter
              air-conditioners. Rainwater is harvested and the resort is 100%
              self-reliant on water which is fantastic. I loved how the resort
              made sure to politely remind the guests of their duty to reduce
              their footprint by decreasing the amount of times they flushed the
              toilets, encouraging guests to turn off the water taps and showers
              and reuse towels. Additionally, there were explicit instructions
              for how to recycle and we were asked to bring our own refillable
              water bottles.
            </p>

            <p>
              I was impressed with some of the less obvious policies the resort
              had implemented. The boats for river safari cruises to and from
              the lodge are equipped with portable Yamaha 4- Stroke outboard
              engines. Its low-noise performance and zero-emission imizes noise,
              pollution and reduces the stress on wildlife and passengers. The
              rooms did not have any radio or television and the Lodge was built
              with local hardwood and all of the furniture was locally-made.
            </p>

            <p>
              I loved my time in Borneo at the Sukau Rainforest Lodge and
              certainly understand why it has won multiple awards for its
              excellence in ecotourism.
