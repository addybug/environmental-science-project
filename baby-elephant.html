            <p>
              I had a great time in Siem Reap, Cambodia.
            </p>

            <p>
              The reason why I came to Siem Reap was to visit the ancient city
              of Angkor. My tour group went by Tuk Tuks, which are small
              carriage-like, open air rides that hold four people and are pulled
              by mopeds, to go to each temple. I visited Angkor Wat first. When
              we arrived, we had to walk down a forested path to get there. The
              area around the temple was beautiful with big shady trees and
              green meadows. It was a majestic structure that is impossible to
              describe because no words could truly capture its beauty. The
              detail of the temple was amazing and apparently it took 300 years
              to build. I went into the temple and walked through the different
              hallways. I then waited in line for about 30 minutes for a chance
              to go to the top area which was referred to as "heaven". The views
              from the top allowed us to see the entire temple grounds and the
              surrounding areas which made for some terrific photos.
            </p>

            <p>
              After Angkor Wat, we took the Tuk Tuks to a neighboring temple
              which was in the same forested area called Angkor Thom. This
              temple was much smaller but had its own unique architecture. The
              weather this day was the hottest we have experienced yet. All of
              us were sweating and drinking as much water as possible. We used
              our umbrellas when we could to try to keep cool. It was even
              sticker and hotter than an Austin summer.
            </p>

            <p>
              After a much needed air conditioned lunch break, we headed to our
              last temple for the day which is called the “Tomb Raider” temple
              because the movie was filmed there. We could see why they would
              pick it for the movie. It was very picturesque, with huge trees
              growing right through the temple structures.
            </p>

            <p>
              Although the hotel I stayed at, Baby Elephant Boutique Hotel,
              branded itself as a sustainable travel location, I felt
              underwhelmed by the sustainable practices that it had adopted. Its
              declarations were vague and immeasurable, using language such as
              “measurably reducing” without giving numbers. However, Baby
              Elephant Boutique Hotel was implementing environmental changes
              that I observed such as encouraging recycling, minimal water use,
              and bikes over Tuk Tuks. Additionally, all the bottles were glass
              and they gave me a bamboo straw rather than a plastic one.
            </p>

              >Baby Elephant Boutique Hotel: Near the Ancient City of Angkor
              Wat</span
            >

            <p>
              Despite the Baby Elephant Boutique Hotel’s lack of extensive
              conservation efforts, I did admire their commitment to the
              Cambodian community. They employ fairly, giving their staff a lot
              of perks such as competitive salaries, nutritious meals, fair work
              hours, and so on. Additionally, Baby Elephant Boutique Hotel
              supports ending child prostitution in Cambodia and is ChildSafe
              Certified.
            </p>

            <p>
              I enjoyed my time in Siem Reap and hope that Baby Elephant
              Boutique Hotel continues to work on their sustainable efforts
              going forward.
